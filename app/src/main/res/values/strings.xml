    <string name="first_tip">If youâ€™re building a home, use fire-resistant building materials. And remember that houses situated fewer than 15 feet apart are at higher risk from wildfires.
\n\nCover attic, eave and sub-floor vents with noncombustible screening.
\n\nSeal the open edges of a barrel tile roof with grout to keep embers from blowing in.
\n\nInstall tempered glass or multi-layered glazed panels in exterior windows, glass doors and skylights.
\n\nAvoid landscaping with combustible bark and wood-chip mulch.
\n\nPlant native, fire-resistant vegetation whenever possible.
\n\nKeep grass cut short and the 30-foot area around your home well watered.
\n\nRemove all dry grass, brush, trees and dead leaves within at least 100 feet from your home.
\n\nStore firewood and fuel sources at least 30 feet downhill from any structure. Better yet, store them uphill if possible.</string>
