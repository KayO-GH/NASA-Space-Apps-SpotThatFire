# NASA-Space-Apps-SpotThatFire
A crowd-sourcing tool for early fire detection

This android app is part of a project in the NASA SpaceApps challenge 2018.

Spot That Fire is a crowd-sourcing tool that uses Machine Learning image labelling to verify reported fires.
Verified fires are then verified via geolocation against NASA's satellite data, and then reported to the appropriate authorities.
